# The Information Effects of Salary Disclosure on Application Rates  During Job Postings

Team: Robert Zhang, Shu Wang, Zheman Zhong, Sheng Zhou, Guang Yang

Introduction
In labor economics, researchers use the “job search and matching theory” framework to improve the
underlying process of job matching efficiency, application rates, and diversity of applicant pools
(Yashiv, 2007). Since finding the ideal match is important for both firms and candidates, how
information is displayed on job posting platforms like LinkedIn and Google Jobs could impact overall
application rate (Gee, 2017). Past research has suggested adding information regarding other people’s
actions (e.g. how many people clicked a button to start an application) will increase the likelihood
of individual job application rate by about 1.9% - 3.6% (Gee, 2017). A recent phenomenon in online
job postings is the disclosure of salary range to narrow the gap of asymmetric information between
employers and potential candidates. Our research goal is to assess the effects of pertinent
salary information on overall application rates. We find this experiment interesting since
it is unclear whether disclosing salaries will create a positive (pay range exceeds expectation) or
negative (pay range below expectation) signal to candidates. Given the ambiguous nature of this
experiment’s outcome, we decide to use Qualtrics survey experiment to observe the impact of salary
disclosure on overall job application rates.
Numerous studies have been done in the demand-side of the job market to analyze how applicant’s
salary history shapes wage offers or how employers have negative inferences about non-disclosing
candidates (Agan, Cowgill, Gee, 2021). However, our research will focus on the supply-side of the
market by studying how different information of job postings impact candidates’ application rate.
We hope our experiment’s outcome can help policymakers and employers create a more efficient
labor market to find the ideal match effectively.
Research Question: Does disclosing salary range on job postings increase candidates’
overall application rate?
Hypothesis: The existence of salary information on job postings increases candidates’
overall application rate for that particular job.
